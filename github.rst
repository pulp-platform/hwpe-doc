IPs to build HWPE-based accelerators:

- https://github.com/pulp-platform/hwpe-stream/ : basic streamer IPs, HWPE-Stream SystemVerilog interfaces
- https://github.com/pulp-platform/hwpe-ctrl/   : basic control IPs
- https://github.com/pulp-platform/hci          : Heterogeneous Cluster Interconnect streamer IPs and interconnect IPs

Simple examples of HWPEs:

- https://github.com/pulp-platform/hwpe-mac-engine : basic HWPE example with basic streamers - MAC engine with single Multiply-Accumulate
- https://github.com/pulp-platform/hwpe-datamover-example : basic HWPE example with HCI streamers - pure datamover

Complex HWPEs:

- https://github.com/pulp-platform/rbe : Reconfigurable Binary Engine - neural accelerator with flexible precision for weights and activations
- https://github.com/pulp-platform/ne16 : Neural Engine (16 input-channels) - neural accelerator with flexible precision for weights
- https://github.com/pulp-platform/redmule : RedMulE (REDuced-precision Matrix MULtipication Engine) is a 8-bit and 16-bit floating-point systolic array
